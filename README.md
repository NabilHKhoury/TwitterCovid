# TwitterCovid
This is a guided project that I completed with Coursera.
This project poses the question: **Are the opinions of users on Twitter positive or negative about Covid-19 tweets that tag covid-19 from July 25 to July 30 2020?**
To answer this question, I used sentimental analysis and data science tools. Sentimental analysis is a way of opinion mining statements or guaging the polarity and rhetoric of a statement. In our case, the texts are tweets.
The data analysis tool used was python. I did the data analysis in jupyter notebook. I also imported many libraries such as pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and plotly for data analysis and visualization.
The raw data was in a csv file, which can be accesed from this [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gabrielpreda/covid-19-tweets/master/covid19_tweets.csv).
I do not reccomend clicking on it as it may take a while to load. 
The steps this project were fairly simple, import the csv file to jupyter notebook using python, prepare the data and preprocess it, then generate polarity scores 
for each tweet, and use data visualization tools to visualize these reults. 
As seen in the source code, the main library used was pandas for the preparing and preprocessing of the data, and then seaborn,plotly, and matplotlib were also used for the data visualization.
These were not the only import, but these were the most fundamental imports.
